                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
</p>
     <p>A full-grown male is about 1.8 to 2.1 metres (6 to 7 feet) long, excluding the 1 metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170 to 230 kg (370 to 500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9 to 1.1 metres, and a weight of 120 to 180 kg. The lionâ€™s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.</p>
