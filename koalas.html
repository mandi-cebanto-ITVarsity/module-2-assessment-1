                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 in) and weighs 4 to 15 kg (9 to 33 lb).
</p>
     <p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. </p>
  
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
